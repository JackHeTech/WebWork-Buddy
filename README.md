# WebWork Expression: Made for humans

## Issues with WebWork inputs: 
- I got tired of getting questions wrong due to imbalanced embedded brackets
- As the expression grows in complexity, the webwork input parser only makes the question even more confusing due to unintuitive mathematical expressions.

## Main use case:
- With the use of Mathquill and some custom algorithms, gone are the days of confusing expressions and imbalanced brackets!
